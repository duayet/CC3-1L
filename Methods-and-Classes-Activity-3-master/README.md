a. Create a class named Student. A Student has fields for an ID number,
number of credit hours earned, and number of points earned. (For example,
many schools compute grade point averages based on a scale of 4, so a
three-credit-hour class in which a student earns an A is worth 12 points.)
Include methods to assign values to all fields. A Student also has a field for
grade point average. Include a method to compute the grade point
average field by dividing points by credit hours earned. Write methods to
display the values in each Student field. Save this class as Student.java.
 b. Write a class named ShowStudent that instantiates a Student object from
the class you created and assign values to its fields. Compute the Student
grade point average, and then display all the values associated with the
Student. Save the application as ShowStudent.java.
