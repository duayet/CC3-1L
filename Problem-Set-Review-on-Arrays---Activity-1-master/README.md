1. Write an application that can hold five integers in an array. Display the
integers from first to last, and then display the integers from last to first. Save
the file as IntArray.java. Use Scanner class.
Sample output:
Enter an integer: 3
Enter an integer: 1
Enter an integer: 5
Enter an integer: 4
Enter an integer: 2
First to Last: 3 1 5 4 2
Last to First: 2 4 5 1 3
2. Write an application that prompts the user to make a choice for a pizza
size— S, M, L, or X—and then displays the price as $6.99, $8.99, $12.50, or
$15.00, accordingly. Display an error message if the user enters an invalid
pizza size. Save the file as PizzaChoice.java. Use JOptionPane class. Hint: Use
two separate arrays to hold the pizza size and the other holding the price.
Sample Output:
Enter Pizza Size ( S, M, L or X):
S
The price of a small pizza is $6.99.
Do you want to try again?
Y
Enter Pizza Size ( S, M, L or X):
F
Invalid.

Enter Pizza Size ( S, M, L or X):
X
The price of an extra large pizza is $15.00. Do you want to try again?
N
Have a nice day!
3. Create an application containing an array that stores 20 prices, such as
$2.34, $7.89, $1.34, and so on. The application should (1) display the sum of all
the prices, (2) display all values less than $5.00, (3) calculate the average of
the prices, and (4) display all values that are higher than the calculated
average value. Save the file as Prices.java. Use Scanner class.
