1. a. Create a class named Exponent. Its main()method accepts an integer
value from a user at the keyboard, and in turn passes the value to a method
that squares the number (multiplies it by itself ) and to a method that cubes
the number (multiplies it by itself twice). The main()method prints the results.
Create the two methods that, respectively, square and cube an integer that
is passed to them, returning the calculated value. Save the application as
Exponent.java.
 b. Modify the Exponent program so that the cubing method calls the
square method, then multiplies that result by the numbers to calculate the
cubed value that it returns. Save the application as Exponent2.java.

2. Write an application that calculates and displays the weekly salary for an
employee. The main()method prompts the user for an hourly pay rate, regular
hours, and overtime hours. Create a separate method to calculate overtime
pay, which is regular hours times the pay rate plus overtime hours times 1.5
times the pay rate; return the result to the main()method to be displayed.
Save the program as Salary.java.
